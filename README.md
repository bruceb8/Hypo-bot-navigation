# Hypo-bot-navigation


This FinalNav skecth is ran on an Arduino Mega 2560. It communicates with a Raspberry PI running OpenCV via serial connection. It implements a basic dead reckoning system to follow a line and return to it once it has finished retrieving a syringe. The robot design utilizes a "U" shaped bumber on the front of the robot to align a syringe for pickup by a robot arm.
